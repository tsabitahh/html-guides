        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that makes up the page. HTML is used to define the different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more.</p>
        <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets '< >'. These tags are used to wrap around content to define its meaning and purpose. For example, the 'p' tag is used to define a paragraph of text, while the 'img' tag is used to embed an image on the page.</p>
        <p>HTML documents typically begin with a '!DOCTYPE html' declaration, which indicates that the document is written in HTML5. The document also includes a 'html' element, which contains all the other elements that make up the page. The 'html' element has two main sections: the '<head>' and the '<body>'.</p>

      <section id="syntax">
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>HTML syntax is written within simple text documents that end with a .html extension. HTML documents consist of text elements that can be read and loaded by a web browser. HTML markup functions through the use of elements, which describe its functionality and are placed within a descending tree structure.</p>
        <p>Some common HTML elements and their semantic meanings include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>h1: Headline or main title</li>
          <li>p: Paragraph or text</li>
          <li>img: Image</li>
          <li>ul: Unordered list </li>
          <li>ol: Ordered list</li>
          <li>table: Table</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>In HTML, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a web page, allowing you to create dynamic and interactive content. In HTML, variables are used to store values that can be reused throughout the document, making it easier to maintain and update content.</p>
        <p>There are two types of variables in HTML:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Attributes: These are used to store values that are associated with an HTML element, such as the href attribute of a link or the src attribute of an image. Attributes are used to provide additional information about an element.</li>
            <li> JavaScript Variables: These are used to store values that are used in JavaScript code, which is executed on the client-side (in the browser). JavaScript variables are used to create dynamic effects, animate elements, and interact with users.</li>
          </ul>
